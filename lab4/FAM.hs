{- Also arrays, dictionaries, tree structures, ... most data structures you can
   think of, and then some.

   Common theme: (a -> b) -> (F a -> F b), where F is a parametrized type.

   There is a class for that!

   class Functor f where
       fmap :: (a -> b) -> (f a -> f b)

   Note: NOT "class Functor (f a)"

   instance Functor [] where
       fmap = map

   instance Functor (Either e) where
       ... like fmap_Either above

   Note: NOT "instance Functor [a]", "instance Functor (Maybe a)",
   "instance Functor (Either e a)".

   This is nothing like you have ever seen.  You have only seen: Generalize from
   "list of Integer" to "list of a".  I'm now telling you: Generalize from "list
   of Integer" to "f of Integer".

   This is like saying: In Java, generalize from List<Integer> to... what?
   (Can't be done. C++ neither.)

   Warning exercise: NOT Collection<Integer>. Why?

   Some data structure examples:
-}

data BinTree a = BTNil | BTNode a (BinTree a) (BinTree a) deriving Show

instance Functor BinTree where
    -- fmap :: (a -> b) -> BinTree a -> BinTree b
    fmap f BTNil = BTNil
    fmap f (BTNode a lt rt) = BTNode (f a) (fmap f lt) (fmap f rt)

{- Functor discussion:

   If you notice that, for data structures, fmap seems to always clone the shape
   and apply f elementwise to the elements, you're right.

   Functor on its own does not have much basic practical use, apart from
   providing a common name "fmap".  But it is much more useful when combined
   with the things below.  It also has an advanced practical use.

   On the other hand, Functor is extremely important in theory.  If you want
   that rabbit hole: Whenever you have an endofunctor F, it induces F-algebras
   and possibly a catamorphism.  The catamorphism of the [] functor is foldr.

   fmap can apply a unary function elementwise to one list (or a maybe, or...).

   What if you want to apply a binary function to all pairs of elements of two
   lists (or two maybes, or...)?

{- And what if you have a 3-ary function and three lists? Four?...  Do you have to
   code them up separately?  Or is there a generalization that covers them all.?

-}

-- ap_List [] as = []
-- ap_List (f:fs) as = map f as ++ ap_List fs as
ap_List fs as = map2_List (\f -> \a -> f a) fs as

--                             = map f [1,2,3] ++ (map g [1,2,3] ++ [])

map2_Listv2 :: (a -> b -> c) -> [a] -> [b] -> [c]
map2_Listv2 f as bs = ap_List (fmap f as) bs

{- One way to understand is to work out some examples. Left as an exercise.

   Another way though is to work out the intermediate types:

   ap_List    (fmap       f          as)         bs
                      a->(b->c)      [a]

map3_List :: (a -> b -> c -> d) -> [a] -> [b] -> [c] -> [d]
map3_List f as bs cs = ((fmap f as) `ap_List` bs) `ap_List` cs

{- Again, exercise: work out some examples.

   But here are the intermediate types:

ap_List (ap_List (fmap f as)   bs)   cs
                 [b->(c->d)]  [b]   [c]
         |<---    [c->d]    --->|
|<---          [d]                --->|
-}

{- Analogous stories for Maybe and Either.  (Unfortunately not BinTree.)

   There is a class for this too!

   class Functor f => Applicative f where
       pure :: a -> f a
       (<*>) :: f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

   "pure" plays two roles:
   * The degenerate case when you have a 0-ary function, kind of.
   * fmap f xs = pure f <*> xs

   Control.Applicative has "liftA2" and "liftA3" which are my "map2" and "map3".

   liftA2 :: Applicative f => (a -> b -> c) -> f a -> f b -> f c
   liftA2 binop as bs = fmap binop as <*> bs

   liftA3 :: Applicative f => (a -> b -> c -> d) -> f a -> f b -> f c -> f d
   liftA3 binop as bs cs = (fmap binop as <*> bs) <*> cs
                         = fmap binop as <*> bs <*> cs

   Applicative is pretty useful in practice, beyond merely common names.
   Examples include liftA2, liftA3, and variations and generalizations, which
   work for all instances of Applicative.

   On the theory side, people are pretty sure that Applicative is important too,
   but it's a fairly recent invention (mathematicians say "discovery"), so there
   is little to show for now.

   * * *

   I now want you to think of [], Maybe, Either e as kinds of programs, not as
   kinds of data structures.

   * Maybe

     foo :: Maybe Int --- This is a program that may suceed and return an Int,
     or may fail.

     `fmap f foo :: Maybe Y` now means: A program that runs foo, then applies f
     to the answer in case of success.

     `pure 4 :: Maybe Int` now means: A program that succeeds and returns 4.

     `bar <*> foo :: Maybe Y` now means: A composite program that runs bar to
     try to obtain a function (call it f); if success, runs foo to try to obtain
     an Int (call it i); if success too, the overall answer is f i.

     `fmap (+) foo <*> foo2` aka `liftA2 (+) foo foo2`: A composite program that
     runs foo for an Int, runs foo2 for another Int, and adds them (if successes
     throughout).

     (Assume f :: Int -> Y, bar :: Maybe (Int -> Y), foo2 :: Maybe Int.)

     Example:
-}
addRecip :: Double -> Double -> Maybe Double
addRecip x y = fmap (+) (recipMay x) <*> recipMay y
  where
    recipMay a | a == 0 = Nothing
               | otherwise = Just (1 / a)
{- Much nicer than:

   addRecip x y =
       case recipMay x of
         Nothing -> Nothing
         Just a -> case recipMay y of
           Nothing -> Nothing
           Just b -> Just (1/a + 1/b)
-}

{-
   * Either e

     foo :: Either String Int --- Like Maybe, but if it fails, it gives you a
     String error message (say).

     `fmap f foo :: Either String Y` now means: Like Maybe, but preserves the
     error message if failure.

     `bar <*> foo :: Either String Y` now means: Like Maybe, but preserves the
     error message of the first failure.

     `fmap (+) foo <*> foo2` aka `liftA2 (+) foo foo2`: Likewise.

   * []

     foo :: [Int] --- This is a non-deterministic program that spawns parallel
     universes and returns a number in each universe.  (Perhaps 0 universes ---
     failure).

     `fmap f foo :: [Y]` now means: A program that runs foo, then in each
     universe, applies f to the answer.

     `pure 4 :: [Int]` means a program that just has one universe and returns 4
     in it.

     `bar <*> foo :: [Y]` now means: A composite program that runs bar (each
     universe has a function), runs foo (each universe has an Int), then for
     each pair of universes, applies the function to the Int.

     `fmap (+) foo <*> foo2` aka `liftA2 (+) foo foo2: A composite program that
     runs foo, runs foo2, then for each pair of universes, adds the respective
     pair of numbers.

   This is pretty versatile already, but there is a limitation.  In `liftA2 (+)
   foo foo2`, foo2 cannot say "I want to know what foo returns before deciding
   what I will return", or vice versa.

   What if you want that kind of data dependence?  Like

   bind :: F a -> (a -> F b) -> F b

   so that you can write `bind foo quaz` to mean: A composite program that runs
   foo, then passes the answer to quaz, and let it decide what to do next?

   And of course sometimes there is no answer --- failure, can't continue with
   quaz; or there are parallel universes --- so one copy of quaz per universe.

bind_Maybe :: Maybe a -> (a -> Maybe b) -> Maybe b
bind_Maybe Nothing _ = Nothing
bind_Maybe (Just a) k = k a

bind_Either :: Either e a -> (a -> Either e b) -> Either e b
bind_Either (Left e) _ = Left e
bind_Either (Right a) k = k a

bind_List :: [a] -> (a -> [b]) -> [b]
bind_List [] _ = []
bind_List (x:xs) k = k x ++ bind_List xs k

{- And there is a class for that too!

   class Applicative f => Monad f where
       return :: a -> f a
       (>>=) :: f a -> (a -> f b) -> f b

   "return" means the same as "pure".  (Do NOT think in terms of control
   flow. "return" does not exit anything.)  It is here for historical reasons
   (because Applicative is more recent).  It will become an alias for "pure" in
   the near future.

   (<*>) can be derived from pure and (>>=):

   fs <*> as =
       fs >>= (\f -> as >>= (\a -> pure (f a)))

   There is also "do-notation" so code looks nicer and the computer emits
   ">>= \v ->" for you:

   fs <*> as =
       do
           f <- fs
           a <- as
           pure (f a)

   Example (based on a true story):
-}

-- Intranet gives me student number, tutorial section
data IntranetRecord = I Integer String deriving Show

-- Blackboard gives me student number, UTORid
data BBRecord = B Integer String deriving Show

-- But MarkUs wants UTORid, tutorial section
data MarkUsRecord = M String String deriving Show

-- Obviously, do a relational join!
myJoin :: [IntranetRecord] -> [BBRecord] -> [MarkUsRecord]
myJoin is bs = [ M u t | I n1 t <- is,
                         B n2 u <- bs,
                         n1 == n2      ]

-- Equivalently:
myJoin2 is bs = do
    I n1 t <- is
    B n2 u <- bs
    if (n1 == n2)
        then pure (M u t)
        else []

{- Monad is very important in theory, in both advanced mathematics and
   programming language semantics.

   On the practical side, here are some uses (in addition to providing common
   names):

   * do-notation is a generalization of list comprehension, and it works for all
     Monad instances.

   * Before there was Applicative, Monad was behind liftA2 etc., e.g.,

         liftM2 binop as bs = do
             a <- as
             b <- bs
             return (binop a b)

   * There is another use shown later.  (Teaser: Dependency injection, template
     method, mock tests.)

   * Here is something that can't be done with just Applicative but can be done
     with Monad:

foldM :: Monad m => (b -> a -> m b) -> b -> [a] -> m b
{- It is like foldl but the "binary operator" is a "program" instead.  E.g.,

         x <- foo 0 1
         y <- foo x 2
         z <- foo y 3
         pure z

   non-deterministic program.  (In Control.Monad, there is a generalization from
